# Code

>data.py

A python script containing functions for handling the data generated by datagenerator.cpp

>datagenerator.cpp

A c++ script that generates 1000 runs of length 1000 (this can be changed in the source code if so desired) of a double pendulum system using RK4. Compiled as g++ datagenerator.cpp -o data.exe

>main.py

The "main" script of the program. This has all the functions that were used to generate plots or the necessary information for the project. Running main.py in itself will not do anything, so whichever function is desired must be appended at the bottom of the script.

>networks.py

The "backend" script of the project. This contains the class Tensorflow and its methods. Some methods go unused as they couldn't be implemented, but are left there to iterate on further should time allow it.

>plotter.py

A python script that contains some plotting functions to visualize the differences between the models with respect to the movement of the pendulum or the training losses.
